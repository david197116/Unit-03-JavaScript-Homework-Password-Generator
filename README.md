# Unit-03-JavaScript-Homework-Password-Generator
Random Password Generator that simply ask for users to select the type of characters and length they want to include in the password. The password is generated and displayed on the screen with the option of copying to clipboard.

I definately was lost at the beginning and spent a lot of time researching how others acomplished this to work. I hope as I move a long  that I can get to the point to build a functional project with minimal use of others input.

User:

1. Enter a number from the range given for you password.
2. Answer the following questions of the types of characters you want to include in the password.
3. Click Generate button to view your password.
4. Click copy to Click Board if you want to use the provided password.
