# Unit-03-JavaScript-Homework-Password-Generator
Random Password Generator that simply ask for users to select the type of characters and length they want to include in the password. The password is generated and displayed on the screen with the option of copying to clipboard.

I definately was lost at the beginning and spent a lot of time researching how others acomplished this to work. I hope as I move a long, that I can get to the point to buid a functional future project with minimal use of others input.
